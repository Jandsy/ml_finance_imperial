        "\n",
        "This study redefines Statistical Arbitrage (StatArb) by combining Autoencoder architectures and policy learning to generate trading strategies. Traditionally, StatArb involves finding the mean of a synthetic asset through classical or PCA-based methods before developing a mean reversion strategy. However, this paper proposes a data-driven approach using an Autoencoder trained on US stock returns, integrated into a neural network representing portfolio trading policies to output portfolio allocations directly.\n",
